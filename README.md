<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

`ae` is a UNIX inspired CLI client for **[Aurae](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae)**, written in Go. However, in order to understand what `ae` should and can do, we must first understand `aer`.

**What is `aer`?**

The intention is to build an automatically generated CLI tool called `aer`, which is based on the Rust client that has the identical scope of a single _[auraed](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/tree/main/auraed)_ node.

The tool will be aimed at "POWER-USERS" and exists as a rapid way to develop and debug against APIs that change frequently. For example, an [auraed](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/tree/main/auraed) developer can make a change to an existing API and test it locally against a single daemon.


**What is `ae`?**

We want to create and maintain a CLI tool, `ae` that is based on the Go client and has a broader view than `aer`.

The purpose will be to use `ae` for clusters of [Aurae](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae) nodes and will probably work similar to `aer`, but not completely!

The `ae` CLI tool will work for a group of nodes and will probably contain more pragmatic functions that are more important for enterprise operators.

**Who is `ae` for?**

The `ae` utility should be familiar to every cloud operator.

_Typical tasks_ such as:

* "Rolling out NGINX to production"
* "Counting the numbers of threads of a process"
* "Changing the current databse connection count for a service"
* Swinging traffic from one to another"

should be possible with `ae`.

There are more "practical" and "impact-oriented" tasks, and these probably need extra functionality, which they add to the lightweight `aer` tool.
